# Programming Projects Overview

Welcome to the **Programming** section of my GitHub portfolio! This directory is organized into projects written in **C** and **Java**, representing a wide range of academic, personal, and exploratory work in computer science.

## Structure

### C Projects
Focused on systems-level programming and core computer science concepts.

- **Compiler for JACK Programming Language**  
  A multi-stage compiler for the JACK language from the Nand2Tetris course. This includes:
  - **Lexer Files**: Tokenization of source code.
  - **Parser Files**: Syntactic analysis and AST construction.
  - **ParserSelfGrader & STSelfGrader**: Test suites and graded exercises for verifying compiler behavior with a range of test cases (e.g., Pong, Square, ComplexArrays).
  - **Symbol Table**: Semantic analysis components and symbol tracking.

- **Library System**  
  A simple console application for managing book inventories and member data, demonstrating structured programming and file operations.

- **Tic Tac Toe 3x3 to 10x10**  
  Dynamic version of Tic Tac Toe that supports varying board sizes and win conditions.

- **Water Consumption Monitoring**  
  A utility for recording and analyzing household water usage over time, built with basic data tracking and I/O.

### Java Projects
Java-based projects emphasize object-oriented design and interactive applications.

- **LC Snippets**  
  A library of common Java coding patterns and solutions to popular algorithm problems (e.g., from LeetCode).

- **Poker Game**  
  A text-based implementation of Poker, supporting multiple players, hand evaluation, and betting logic.

- **Wordle Game**  
  Java recreation of the popular word-guessing game with terminal-based feedback.

This directory reflects a hands-on exploration of both low-level and high-level programming topics, from parsing and compiling to game development and data analysis.
