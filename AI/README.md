# Artificial Intelligence 🤖

Welcome to my AI Projects! 🌟 Here, you'll find some of my recent work in the field of Artificial Intelligence, where I’ve explored how AI can positively impact communities. From machine learning 🧠 to computer vision 👁️, there's various AI tools and models I’ve worked with. 🚀

Speed, accuracy, and scalability were key considerations during my hands-on experience with model training and inferencing using GPUs for efficient performance.

## Key achievements

- **IBM Visual Insights** 📸: Leveraged this powerful computer vision tool to analyze images, creating models that can classify and detect objects with high accuracy. For example, I worked on detecting broken bones in X-rays of the human body.
  
- **H2O.ai** 💧: Explored the use of machine learning models in this environment to make data-driven predictions. Includes examples of training, validating, and deploying models.

- **New Directions in AI** : I spoke at a conference in the SRM Institute of Technology in front of 150+ attendees about the basics of AI and recent developments in this field.

My work here highlights a commitment to using cutting-edge AI technologies and tools to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s deploying a machine learning model or testing inference on GPUs, I aim to push the boundaries of AI to benefit various communities. 🌍🤖
