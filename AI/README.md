# Artificial Intelligence 🤖

Welcome to my AI Projects! Here, you'll find some of my recent work in the field of Artificial Intelligence, where I’ve explored how AI can positively impact communities. From machine learning to computer vision, there's various AI tools and models I’ve worked with. 

Speed, accuracy, and scalability were key considerations during my hands-on experience with model training and inferencing using GPUs for efficient performance.

## Key achievements

- **IBM Visual Insights**: Leveraged this powerful computer vision tool to analyze images, creating models that can classify and detect objects with high accuracy. For example, I worked on detecting broken bones in X-rays of the human body.
  
- **H2O.ai**: Explored the use of machine learning models in this environment to make data-driven predictions. Includes examples of training, validating, and deploying models.

- **New Directions in AI** : I spoke at a conference in the SRM Institute of Technology in front of 150+ attendees, introducing AI and covering recent developments in this field.

My work here highlights a commitment to using cutting-edge AI technologies and tools to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s deploying a machine learning model or testing inference on GPUs, I aim to push the boundaries of AI to benefit various communities.
