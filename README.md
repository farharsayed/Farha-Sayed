The following projects are included in this repo:

  -  **Kubernetes Research Project  ⎈** : This folder contains some of my work from a research project I completed in 2024, titled **'Proactive Autoscaling in Kubernetes'**. It shows use of concepts such as **Virtualization** and **Containerization**.
  -  **Observability Applications  ☁️** : These are some apps I've deployed on Red Hat OpenShift to create a scalable observability stack.
  -    **Carpe Vitae Capital 📈** : I've shared some of the code written in our group of 3 when we created this simple financial asset visualization webpage.
  -  **Artificial Intelligence 🤖**: Explored how AI can benefit communities with tools like IBM Visual Insights (computer vision) and H2O.ai (machine learning).
  -  **Programming Samples 🖧** (to be added) : Here lie some sample coding pieces in various languages that I have learnt over the years. A lot of this work was created for academic purposes and is only intended to be shared with you.
