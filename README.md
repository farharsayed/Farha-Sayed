# My Projects 💻🛠️

Hi👋 Welcome to my **Tech Projects**! I've made a collection of some of my recent work to easily share with recruiters and friends.


## List of Projects

The following projects are included in this repo:

-  **Kubernetes Research Project  ⎈** : This folder contains some of my work from a research project I completed in 2024, titled **'Proactive Autoscaling in Kubernetes'**. It shows use of concepts such as **Virtualization** and **Containerization📦**.
-  **Observability Applications  ☁️** : These are sample apps I've deployed on a Minikube cluster☸️ using **Docker Desktop🐳** to test their functions.
-  **Programming Samples 🖧** : Here lie some sample coding pieces🖥️ in different languages over the years. A lot of this work was created for school/university👩‍💻 and this is intended to be shared with only you.
-  **Carpe Vitae Capital 💹** : I've shared some of the code written by our group of 3 when we created this Platform📈.
