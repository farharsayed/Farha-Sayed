Welcome to my **Tech Projects**! I've made a collection of some of my recent work to easily share with recruiters and friends.


## List of Projects

The following projects are included in this repo:

  -  **Kubernetes Research Project  âŽˆ** : This folder contains some of my work from a research project I completed in 2024, titled **'Proactive Autoscaling in Kubernetes'**. It shows use of concepts such as **Virtualization** and **ContainerizationðŸ“¦**.
  -  **Carpe Vitae Capital ðŸ’¹** : I've shared some of the code written by our group of 3 when we created this PlatformðŸ“ˆ.
  -  **Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–**: Explored how AI can benefit communities with tools like IBM Visual Insights (computer vision) and H2O.ai (machine learning).

  -  **Observability Applications  â˜ï¸** (to be added) : These are sample apps I've deployed on a Minikube clusterâ˜¸ï¸ using **Docker DesktopðŸ³** to test their functions.
  -  **Programming Samples ðŸ–§** (to be added) : Here lie some sample coding piecesðŸ–¥ï¸ in different languages over the years. A lot of this work was created for school/universityðŸ‘©â€ðŸ’» and this is intended to be shared with only you.
