# Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to my AI Projects! Here, you'll find some of my work exploring AI and ML.
Speed, accuracy, and scalability were key considerations during my hands-on experience with model training and inferencing using GPUs for efficient performance.

## Key achievements

- **IBM Visual Insights**: Leveraged this powerful computer vision tool to analyze images, creating models that can classify and detect objects with high accuracy. For example, I worked on detecting broken bones in X-rays of the human body.
  
- **H2O.ai**: Explored the use of machine learning models in this environment to make data-driven predictions. Includes examples of training, validating, and deploying models.

- **New Directions in AI** : I spoke at a conference in the SRM Institute of Technology in front of 150+ attendees, introducing AI and covering recent developments in this field.
