# Programming Projects Overview

Welcome to the **Programming** section of my GitHub portfolio! This directory is organized into projects written for **C programming**, **Java programming** and **AI** containing **Python code**, representing a wide range of academic, personal, and exploratory work in computer science.
This directory reflects a hands-on exploration of both low-level and high-level programming topics, from parsing and compiling to game development and data analysis.

## Content Layout

- ### Java Projects
  Java-based projects emphasize object-oriented design and interactive applications.

  - **Poker Game**  
    A text-based implementation of Poker, supporting multiple players, hand evaluation, and betting logic.

  - **Wordle Game**  
    Java recreation of the popular word-guessing game with terminal-based feedback.

  - **LC Snippets**  
    A library of common Java coding patterns and solutions to popular algorithm problems from LeetCode.

- ### AI Projects/Python Code
  Focused on machine learning, automation, and intelligent systems.

  - **Decision Trees Project**  
    Implementation of decision tree algorithms for classification problems. Includes dataset preprocessing, training, and model evaluation.

  - **ML Project**  
    A broader exploration of machine learning tasks, including regression, clustering, and neural networks. Demonstrates the use of ML libraries and performance tuning.

  - **Robot Worker Project**  
    A robot worker simulation showcasing logic for task delegation, state machines, and behavior modeling.

- ### C Projects

  - **Compiler for JACK Programming Language**  
    This project contains a compiler implementation for the JACK programming language, as introduced in the Nand2Tetris course. It includes lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation to VM code.

  - **Library System**
    A simple C-based system to manage book check-ins, check-outs, and library member information. Demonstrates use of structures, file handling, and menu-        driven programming.

  - **Tic Tac Toe 3x3 to 10x10**  
    This is a scalable version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The program allows the user to choose the size of the board, ranging from 3x3 up to 10x10.         Implements win condition logic for dynamic grid sizes.

  - **Water Consumption Monitoring**  
    A basic application written in C to log and analyze household water usage. Users can input daily usage and receive feedback on trends and average     consumption.
